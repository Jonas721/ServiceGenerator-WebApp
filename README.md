# ServiceGenerator-WebApp
A simple web application to facilitate the creation of service order documents for churches

## Overview
This is the final project for a database class I took in 2023. It is a python flask app that creates a web GUI to allow users to create an order of service document for an event like a church service. It allows the creation of service events that are stored and read from a MySQL database.
<br><br>
It is a rudimentary app that was my introduction to how a web application can interact with databases. It is functional, but its current state could be much improved.

## How to Run
(Assuming Python is installed)<br>
- In the console, run 
`pip install mysql-connector-python` and 
`pip install flask` to download the necessary requirememts. <br>
- MySQL must also be running on your machine.<br>
- To start the application run `python wsoapp.py`
